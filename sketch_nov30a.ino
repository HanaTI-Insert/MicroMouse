/*
  ButtonMouseControl
 
 Controls the mouse from five pushbuttons on an Arduino Leonardo or Micro.
 
 Hardware:
 * 5 pushbuttons attached to D2, D3, D4, D5, D6
 
 
 The mouse movement is always relative. This sketch reads 
 four pushbuttons, and uses them to set the movement of the mouse.
 
 WARNING:  When you use the Mouse.move() command, the Arduino takes
 over your mouse!  Make sure you have control before you use the mouse commands.
